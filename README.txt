#Idea

The player tries to find a truck toy in the store and gives it to the kid for him to stop crying and become happy during 3 minutes.

When I brainstorm about the storyline and the theme of the store, 
I wanted it to be something familiar to users so I have choices( toys r us ) as the old brand of toys for kids,
I loved this brand as I was a kid and it's something only achievable in a virtual world because (toys r us does not exist now). 


Initial ideas from brainstorming
================================
a game for fun to make a little boy stop crying

1- scale
2- locomotion
3- gamification
4- empathy(crying)
5-animation
6- Diegetic UI (the reason of crying)
7- computer shader (in middle tree)
8-  TV video player
9 - physics (gapping the to reponse to gravity)


user test:
================================
    user1 :"the kid hasn't cry all the time is's an annying sound"
	user2: "butting algit above trees"
Emotions: Crying & Laughing.
